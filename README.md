# autopay
A python script to automate Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) bill payments using Selenium and the Firefox WebDriver (geckodriver)

# Steps to perform before running
  1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) of the Firefox WebDriver
     *(Note:The WebDriver must be saved in the same directory as autopay.py. I have used the "geckodriver-v0.34.0-win64" release)*
  
  2. Update Payment Card and SLT Account Details values in the .env file (An example .env file has been added to the repo for convenience)
